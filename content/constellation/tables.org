* Dynamic Filters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tables-dynamic-filters
:END:

Dynamic filters can be created, allowing Constellation tables to be filtered based on User properties.

On the permission, the /Process Status Filter/ is configured as normal, except the value to be replaced by a user field is wrapped in braces. \\
e.g. \\
#+begin_src txt
Branch:{Branch},PaymentCode:SG
#+end_src

In the above example, is a user has a /Branch/ field (e.g. HRE) then ~{Branch}~ will be substituted when data for the table is requested.
