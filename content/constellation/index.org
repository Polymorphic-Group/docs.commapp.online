#+begin_src text

In the example above, Title will be required.

** Optional form sections

On a multi section form, sections can be hidden if the field deffinition starts with a filter value.\\
A filter value will be in the format ~{"FieldName":"Condition"}~ and be the first item on the row.

#+NAME: src-optional-section

* Custom User Dashboards

A Custom User dashboard can be created by setting the ~Dashboard~ field on the User instance in Musketeer.

An example ~Dashboard~ is bellow.

#+CAPTION: /Dashboard/ example.
#+begin_src json
[
    {
      "chart": {
        "fllChartId": 2922,
        "title": "Customer status",
        "dateField": "Date"
      },
      "colSpan": 4,
      "rowSpan": 1
    },
    {
      "chart": {
        "fllChartId": 2940,
        "title": "Payment",
        "dateField": "Date"
      },
      "rowSpan": 1,
      "colSpan": 1
    },
    {
      "chart": {
        "fllChartId": 2800,
        "title": "Weight by PC",
        "dateField": "DateOfReceipt"
      },
      "rowSpan": 1,
      "colSpan": 1
    },
    {
      "chart": {
        "fllChartId": 2801,
        "title": "Payment Code Count",
        "dateField": "DateOfReceipt"
      },
      "rowSpan": 1,
      "colSpan": 1
    },
    {
      "chart": {
        "fllChartId": 2887,
        "title": "Quote Value"
      },
      "rowSpan": 1,
      "colSpan": 1
    }
]
#+end_src

** Dashboard to Permission link
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dashboard-permission-link
:END:

A dashboard can be given a link to a permission.

This is done by adding a "permission" property to user's /Dashboard/, as in the example below.

#+begin_src json
[
    {
      "chart": {
        "fllChartId": 2922,
        "title": "Customer status",
        "dateField": "Date"
      },
      "permission": "test-permission",
      "colSpan": 4,
      "rowSpan": 1
    }
]
#+end_src



* Invoice Forms

Invoice forms allow table rows to be added inlinde while capturing data.

These instructions assume knowlage on configuring a standard permssions.

** Basic FLL Setup

*** Musketeer Configuration

Three tables are required in Muskteer.

[[./invoice-basic-setup-fll.png]]

+ Item source table (1) ::
  It is advised that this is a library table.
  This holds the deffinitions of items that will be selected on the form.
  If the form is for invoices this will hold a list of possible broducs that are being invoiced for.

+ Main table (2) ::
  This is the main table that is used to hold invoices, receiepts, purchase orders, etc.

+ Item table (3) ::
  It is advised that this inherits from the source table, so long that the source table is a library.
  This table holds line items of the main record.
  These are imported from the source table.

**** Permssion Configuration

Two permissions are required to be created.

***** The Item permission

Needs to reference the item table (3).

***** The Main permssion

Needs to reference the main table (2).

To add the input table into the form, two things need to be done:

1. The item permission needs to be added as level 2.

2. A special line[fn:: On an invoice form, field rows will be broken into rows. The item table field should be on it's own row.] needs to be added to the /Form Add/ field.
   This needs to be in the format ,without spaces, item permission, colon, and the FLL ID of the Item Source table (1), ~item-permission:source-fll~.
