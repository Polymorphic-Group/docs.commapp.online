* Invoice Forms

Invoice forms allow table rows to be added inlinde while capturing data.

These instructions assume knowlage on configuring a standard permssions.

** Basic FLL Setup

*** Musketeer Configuration

Three tables are required in Muskteer.

[[./invoice-basic-setup-fll.png]]

+ Item source table (1) ::
  It is advised that this is a library table.
  This holds the deffinitions of items that will be selected on the form.
  If the form is for invoices this will hold a list of possible broducs that are being invoiced for.

+ Main table (2) ::
  This is the main table that is used to hold invoices, receiepts, purchase orders, etc.

+ Item table (3) ::
  It is advised that this inherits from the source table, so long that the source table is a library.
  This table holds line items of the main record.
  These are imported from the source table.

**** Permssion Configuration

Two permissions are required to be created.

***** The Item permission

Needs to reference the item table (3).

***** The Main permssion

Needs to reference the main table (2).

To add the input table into the form, two things need to be done:

1. The item permission needs to be added as level 2.

2. A special line[fn:: On an invoice form, field rows will be broken into rows. The item table field should be on it's own row.] needs to be added to the /Form Add/ field.
   This needs to be in the format ,without spaces, item permission, colon, and the FLL ID of the Item Source table (1), ~item-permission:source-fll~.
